## Repository Overview

This repo is a growing collection of TryHackMe walkthroughs and study notes, organized by platform and technique. Each entry aims to be concise and actionable: a short summary of the lab, stepwise reasoning, the important commands and snippets used, and a final "What I learned" section.  
Use the folders to quickly find machine-specific writeups or browse by topic to study particular skills (enumeration, exploitation, post-exploitation, privilege escalation, forensics, and more).
